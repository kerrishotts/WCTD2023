# WCTD 2023 JavaScript Code

This is the code repository used for the We Connect the Docs 20203 Level 2 JavaScript learning sessions.

There are two folders:

* snippets — small samples illustrating specific aspects of JavaScript & interaction with the browser
* examples — larger examples putting all the concepts together to make a full feature

Each sample is numbered in chronological order as presented in the presentation.
