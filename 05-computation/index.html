               you may see different variations that still
               mean the same thing.
               
               You should absolutely test any formulas you
               come across with several values. For example:
              
               77F = 25C
               32F = 0C
               -40F = -40C
            */
            const degreesC = (degreesF - 32) * 5/9;
            alert (`${degreesF}°F is ${degreesC}°C`);
